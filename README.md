🧹 1. Data Cleaning — Power Query ETL Steps

Performed using Power Query (ETL):

Removed null rows and duplicate records

Standardized column data types (Date, Text, Numbers)

Split and reformatted ORDERDATE to remove timestamp

Cleaned inconsistent delimiters (e.g., “-” vs “/”)

Renamed columns to maintain uniform structure

Loaded cleaned output as an Excel Table: Cleaned_Dataset

ETL Skills Demonstrated:
Data Extraction → Cleaning → Transformation → Loading

🧮 2. Excel Functions Used

Used across a dedicated Formulas sheet:

SUMIF → Sales by country

COUNTIF → Count of shipped orders

VLOOKUP → Lookup sales details for a specific order

AVERAGE → Average order value

MAX/MIN → Identify range of sales values

IF & Text Functions → Categorization and cleaning

These formulas document the analytical approach clearly and systematically.

📈 3. Pivot Tables Created

Pivot tables were created to support deeper analysis:

Sales by Year

Sales by Month

Sales by Country / Territory

Sales by Product Line

Top 10 Customers by Revenue

These pivot tables served as the source for dashboard charts.
